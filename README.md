# NM_DA_WATER_QUALITY
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: Access to clean and safe drinking water is a fundamental necessity for human well-being. It is essential for maintaining public health and preventing waterborne diseases. The problem at hand revolves around the analysis of water quality data, which is represented by various key parameters. These parameters include pH, Hardness, Solids, Chloramines, Sulfate, Conductivity, Organic_carbon, Trihalomethanes, Turbidity, and Potability. The primary objective of this analysis is to comprehensively assess the quality of water to evaluate its suitability for specific purposes, primarily drinking, and make informed decisions regarding its potability. Through data analytics, visualizations, and predictive modeling, we aim to make informed decisions regarding water safety, contributing to public well-being.
